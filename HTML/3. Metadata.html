- Everything in the <head> is actually metadata

- Mainly 2 main types of "meta" tags:
 
1. Pragma directives [ using 'http-equiv' attribute ]
2. Named meta types  [ using 'name' attribute ]

<!--Pragma directives-->

- When the http-equiv attribute is specified on a meta element, the element is a pragma directive.
- These directives describe how a page should be parsed
- 7 Pragma directives in spec :

<!--

- Common pragma directives : "refresh" & "content-security-policy"[important]

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60; https://machinelearningworkshop.com/regTimeout" />

- you can set a directive to refresh at an interval of the number of seconds set in the content attribute, and even redirect to a different URL

<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content="default-src https:" />

<!----Open Graph---->

- Open Graph and similar meta tag protocols can be used to control how social media sites, like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook, display links to your content.

- Creating a FB media card: 

<meta property="og:title" content="Machine Learning Workshop" />
<meta property="og:description" content="School for Machines Who Can't Learn Good and Want to Do Other Stuff Good Too" />
<meta property="og:image" content="http://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/image/all.png" />
<meta property="og:image:alt" content="Black and white line drawing of refrigerator, french door refrigerator, range, washer, fan, microwave, vaccuum, space heater and air conditioner" />

- These meta tags are all defined in the Open Graph protocol. 
- The values should be the content you would like the third-party web application to display.
