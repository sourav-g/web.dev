- if you use non-semantic 'div', have to comment each closing 
  div to keep track which one it closes


- Made semantic with role addition :

  <!-- start header -->
  <div role="banner">
    <div role="heading" aria-level="1">Machine Learning Workshop</div>
    <div role="navigation">
      <a href="#reg">Register</a>
      <a href="#about">About</a>
      <a href="#teachers">Instructors</a>
      <a href="#feedback">Testimonials</a>
    </div>
    <!-- end navigation bar -->
  <div>
  <!-- end of header -->


- Native semantic elements used : [ better ]

  <header>
    <h1>Machine Learning Workshop</h1>
    <nav>
      <a href="#reg">Register</a>
      <a href="#about">About</a>
      <a href="#teachers">Instructors</a>
      <a href="#feedback">Testimonials</a>
    </nav>
  </header>

- This is the main header. The <header> element isn't always a landmark. It has different semantics depending on where it is nested. 
- When the <header> is top level, it is the site banner, a landmark role, which you may have noted in the role code block. When a <header> is nested in <main>, <article>, or <section>, it just identifies it as the header for that section and isn't a landmark.

<!-- Document Structure-->


<body>
    <header>Header</header>           // implicit role : banner        [only for top level]
    <nav>Nav</nav>
    <main>
      <article>First post</article>
      <article>Second post</article>
    </main>
    <aside>Aside</aside>
    <footer>Footer</footer>           // implicit role : content info  [only for top level]
</body>

<!--main-->

- There's a single <main> landmark element.
- The <main> element identifies the main content of the document. 
- There should be only one <main> per page.


<!--<aside>-->    // implicit role : complementary.

- The <aside> is for content that is indirectly or tangentially related to the document's main content.


<!--<article> -->    

- An <article> represents a complete, or self-contained, section of content that is, in principle, independently reusable. 
- Think of an article as you would an article in a newspaper.        


<!--<section>-->

- When there is no more specific semantic element to use. 
- Sections should have a heading, with very few exceptions.  
- A <section> isn't a landmark unless it has an accessible name; if it has an accessible name, the implicit role is region

<!--## Headings: <h1> - <h6> ---------->

  - <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>
  - Each represents one of the six levels of section headings, with 
    <h1> being the highest or most important section level, and 
    <h6> the lowest.
