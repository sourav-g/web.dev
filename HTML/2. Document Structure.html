<!--*************************-->

-Document type declaration and the <html> root element.

<!DOCTYPE html>  

-Not an HTML Element
-Special kind of node called "doctype"
-Tells browser to use "standards mode", hence preventing "quirks mode" rendering

(<a>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode</a>)

<!-- How do I see which mode is used? -->

document.compatMode - "BackCompat" -> implies doc rendered in quirks mode
document.compatMode - "CSS1Compat" -> implies doc rendered in standards (no-quirks) mode


<html lang="fr-CA">

langcode-region
"fr-CA"
"fr-BF"
"en-US"

-The lang language attribute added to the <html> tag defines the main language of the document. 
-This language declaration enables screen readers, search engines, and translation services to know the document language.
-Not limited to html tag, can be added elsewhere to indicate different language
-Only adds semantics, enabling assistive tech to know the language of the impacted content
-**Can be used in CSS selectors

Eg - <span lang="fr-fr">Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</span>

-Can be targeted with attribute & language selectors - [lang|="fr"] and :lang(fr)

<head>

-Document metadata header, contains all the metadata for a site or application.    

* document title    [ always add ]
* character set     [ always add ]
* viewport settings [ always add ]
* description
* baseURL
* stylesheet links
* icons

<!--Character encoding-->

- Very first thing in head
- It comes before the title to ensure the browser can render the characters in that title and all the characters in the rest of the document.
- The default encoding in most browsers is windows-1252, depending on the locale.
- ** Should use 'utf-8' as it enables the one- to four-byte encoding of all characters
- ** utf-8 required for HTML5
- can use emojis with utf-8 (but dont)

<meta charset="utf-8" />


<!--Document Title-->

- Displayed in the browser tab, the list of open windows, the history, search results, and, unless redefined with <meta> tags, in social media cards.

<title>Machine Learning Workshop</title>


<!--Viewport metadata-->

** Viewport **
--------------

- It refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window.
- Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view.
- Layout viewport ==> 
    The layout viewport is the viewport into which the browser draws a web page. 
    Essentially, it represents what is available to be seen
- Visual viewport ==> 
    Represents what is currently visible on the user's display device.
    [window.visualViewport]

** Viewport metadata **
-----------------------

- helps site responsiveness, enabling content to render well by default, no matter the viewport width.
- it enables controlling a viewport's size and scale, and prevents the site's content from being sized down to fit a 960px site onto a 320px screen, it is definitely recommended.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />

- Above html means "make the site responsive, starting by making the width of the content the width of the screen"
- you can set zoom and scalability, but they both default to accessible values. If need to be explicit, include :

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1" />

The basic properties of the "viewport" <meta> tag include:

* width              -> Controls the size of the viewport
                        width=600            (px)
                        width=device-width   (which is 100vw, 100% of viewport width)
                        1 < width < 10000

* height             -> Controls height of the viewport
                        height=400            (px)
                        width=device-height   (which is 100vh, 100% of viewport height)
                        1 < 10000 < 10000

* initial-scale      -> Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded
                        0.1 < initial-scale < 10   [ Default: 1 ]

* minimum-scale      -> Controls how much "zoom out" is allowed on the page
                        0.1 < initial-scale < 10   [ Default: 0.1 ]

* maximum-scale      -> Controls how much "zoom in" is allowed on the page
                        Any value less than 3 fails accessibility.
                        0.1 < initial-scale < 10   [ Default: 10 ]

* user-scalable      -> Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page.
                        0, 1, yes, no  [ Default: 1 (yes)]
                        Setting to 0 (no), is against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
                        <a>https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance</a>

                        {  WCAG requires a minimum of 2× scaling; however, the best practice is to enable a 5× zoom. }


* interactive-widget -> Specifies the effect that interactive UI widgets, such as a virtual keyboard, have on the page's  viewports. resizes-visual, resizes-content, or overlays-content. Default: resizes-visual


<!--CSS -->

- The <link> tag is the preferred method of including stylesheets. 
- The rel attribute defines the relationship: in this case stylesheet. If you omit this, your CSS will not be linked.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

//Read Later :: There are other ways to link : cascade layers,etc


<!--Why to load styles in head ?-->

- They will work if included in the document's body, but you want your styles in the head for performance reasons. 
- You actually want the browser to know how to render the content (body) when it is loaded
- Adding styles first prevents the unnecessary repainting that occurs if an element is styled after it is first rendered.
