<!--*************************-->

-Document type declaration and the <html> root element.

<!DOCTYPE html>  

-Not an HTML Element
-Special kind of node called "doctype"
-Tells browser to use "standards mode", hence preventing "quirks mode" rendering

(<a>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode</a>)

<!-- How do I see which mode is used? -->

document.compatMode - "BackCompat" -> implies doc rendered in quirks mode
document.compatMode - "CSS1Compat" -> implies doc rendered in standards (no-quirks) mode


<html lang="fr-CA">

langcode-region
"fr-CA"
"fr-BF"
"en-US"

-The lang language attribute added to the <html> tag defines the main language of the document. 
-This language declaration enables screen readers, search engines, and translation services to know the document language.
-Not limited to html tag, can be added elsewhere to indicate different language
-Only adds semantics, enabling assistive tech to know the language of the impacted content
-**Can be used in CSS selectors

Eg - <span lang="fr-fr">Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</span>

-Can be targeted with attribute & language selectors - [lang|="fr"] and :lang(fr)

<head>

-Document metadata header, contains all the metadata for a site or application.    

* document title    [ always add ]
* character set     [ always add ]
* viewport settings [ always add ]
* description
* baseURL
* stylesheet links
* icons

<!--Character encoding-->

- Very first thing in head
- It comes before the title to ensure the browser can render the characters in that title and all the characters in the rest of the document.
- The default encoding in most browsers is windows-1252, depending on the locale.
- ** Should use 'utf-8' as it enables the one- to four-byte encoding of all characters
- ** utf-8 required for HTML5
- can use emojis with utf-8 (but dont)

<meta charset="utf-8" />


<!--Document Title-->

- Displayed in the browser tab, the list of open windows, the history, search results, and, unless redefined with <meta> tags, in social media cards.

<title>Machine Learning Workshop</title>


<!--Viewport metadata-->

** Viewport **
--------------

- It refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window.
- Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view.
- Layout viewport ==> 
    The layout viewport is the viewport into which the browser draws a web page. 
    Essentially, it represents what is available to be seen
- Visual viewport ==> 
    Represents what is currently visible on the user's display device.
    [window.visualViewport]

** Viewport metadata **
-----------------------

- helps site responsiveness, enabling content to render well by default, no matter the viewport width.
- it enables controlling a viewport's size and scale, and prevents the site's content from being sized down to fit a 960px site onto a 320px screen, it is definitely recommended.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />

- Above html means "make the site responsive, starting by making the width of the content the width of the screen"
- you can set zoom and scalability, but they both default to accessible values. If need to be explicit, include :

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1" />

The basic properties of the "viewport" <meta> tag include:

* width              -> Controls the size of the viewport
                        width=600            (px)
                        width=device-width   (which is 100vw, 100% of viewport width)
                        1 < width < 10000

* height             -> Controls height of the viewport
                        height=400            (px)
                        width=device-height   (which is 100vh, 100% of viewport height)
                        1 < 10000 < 10000

* initial-scale      -> Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded
                        0.1 < initial-scale < 10   [ Default: 1 ]

* minimum-scale      -> Controls how much "zoom out" is allowed on the page
                        0.1 < initial-scale < 10   [ Default: 0.1 ]

* maximum-scale      -> Controls how much "zoom in" is allowed on the page
                        Any value less than 3 fails accessibility.
                        0.1 < initial-scale < 10   [ Default: 10 ]

* user-scalable      -> Controls whether zoom in and zoom out actions are allowed on the page.
                        0, 1, yes, no  [ Default: 1 (yes)]
                        Setting to 0 (no), is against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
                        <a>https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance</a>

                        {  WCAG requires a minimum of 2× scaling; however, the best practice is to enable a 5× zoom. }


* interactive-widget -> Specifies the effect that interactive UI widgets, such as a virtual keyboard, have on the page's  viewports. resizes-visual, resizes-content, or overlays-content. Default: resizes-visual


<!--CSS -->

- The <link> tag is the preferred method of including stylesheets. 
- The rel attribute defines the relationship: in this case stylesheet. If you omit this, your CSS will not be linked.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

//Read Later :: There are other ways to link : cascade layers,etc


<!--Why to load styles in head ?-->

- They will work if included in the document's body, but you want your styles in the head for performance reasons. 
- You actually want the browser to know how to render the content (body) when it is loaded
- Adding styles first prevents the unnecessary repainting that occurs if an element is styled after it is first rendered.


<!--Other uses of the <link> element-->

- The link element is used to create relationships between the HTML document and external resources.
- Some of these resources may be downloaded, others are informational.
- There are currently 25 available values for the rel attribute that can be used with <link>, <a> and <area>, or <form>, with a few that can be used with all. <a> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#linkTypes </a>
- It's preferable to include those related to meta information in the head and those related to performance in the <body>.


** Favicon
----------

- A favicon is a very small icon that appears on the browser tab, generally to the left of the document title. 
- If you don't declare a favicon, the browser will look for a file named favicon.ico in the top-level directory (the website's root folder). 

<link rel="icon" sizes="16x16 32x32 48x48" type="image/png" href="/images/mlwicon.png" />

- "use the mlwicon.png as the icon for scenarios where a 16px, 32px, or 48px makes sense."
-  For scalable icons : sizes = "any"
                    or, sizes = < space-separated list of square widthXheight values; where the width and height values are 16, 32, 48, or greater in that geometric sequence >


** Alternate versions of the site
---------------------------------

- We use the alternate value of the rel attribute to identify translations, or alternate representations, of the site.

<link rel="alternate" href="https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/fr/" hreflang="fr-FR" />
<link rel="alternate" href="https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/pt/" hreflang="pt-BR" />
<link rel="alternate" type="application/x-pdf" href="https://machinelearningworkshop.com/mlw.pdf" />

** Canonical 
------------

- If you create several translations or versions of Machine Learning Workshop, search engines may get confused as to which version is the authoritative source. For this, use rel="canonical" to identify the preferred URL for the site or application.

<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.machinelearning.com" />


<!--Scripts-->

- The default type is JavaScript
- If you include any other scripting language, include the type attribute with the mime type, or type="module" if it's a JavaScript module.
- Only JavaScript and JavaScript modules get parsed and executed.

<!--Why scripts loaded at bottom of the body ?-->
- JavaScript is not only render-blocking, but the browser stops downloading all assets when scripts are downloaded and doesn't resume downloading other assets until the JavaScript is executed. For this reason, you will often find JavaScript requests at the end of the document rather than in the head.

<!--Two attributes which reduces blocking nature of JS download & execution : async & defer -->

* with defer :
  -> parallel download , HTML rendering NOT blocked
  -> defered execution, once HTML is rendered

* with async :
  -> parallel download , HTML rendering NOT blocked
  -> immediate execution with HTML rendering BLOCKED
