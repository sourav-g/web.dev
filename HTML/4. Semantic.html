- Semantic means "relating to meaning". 
- Writing semantic HTML means using HTML elements to structure your content based on each element's meaning, not its appearance.
- ** Semantic markup gives a context to our content.

<header>
    <h1>Three words</h1>
    <nav>
      <a>one word</a>
      <a>one word</a>
    </nav>
</header>
<main>
    <aside></aside>
    <article></article>
    <section>
        <h2>three words</h2>
        <p>forty-six words</p>
        <p>forty-four words</p>
    </section>
</main>
<footer>
    <p>five words</p>
</footer>

- With semantic elements, provides enough context for a non-coder to decipher the purpose and meaning without having ever encountered an HTML tag.
- ** Semantic markup isn't just about making markup easier for developers to read; it's mostly about making markup easy for automated tools to decipher.
